## MNIST Data Exercise

This workflow builds CNN models to classify the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
The model prediction performance is measured on each of the MNIST digits in the test dataset.
The model performance scores are then used to extract the most ambiguous, or hardest to classify,
MNIST digits and saves these images to a folder.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8.0
- pip

The ambiguous images are saved in the images folder.

You can install the dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can launch JupyterLab with: `jupyter-lab`

The exercise can be executed through `SoT_Test.ipynb`
